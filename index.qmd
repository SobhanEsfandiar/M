Welcome to my personal website! 

I am Mohammadsobhan Esfandiar, a passionate researcher specializing in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), with a particular focus on Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR) in robotics, physical interaction design, and the role of social psychology in HRI. Currently, I am pursuing an MSc in Research Methods of Psychological Science at the University of Glasgow, where I am deepening my knowledge and skills in psychological research methodologies.

My academic journey will continue with a PhD focused on social touch in Human-Robot Interaction, exploring the ways in which touch influences the dynamics between humans and robots. My background in mechanical engineering and design has provided me with a strong foundation in technical craftsmanship, which complements my research pursuits.

I enjoy investigating innovative and creative approaches within my field, always striving to push the boundaries of conventional research to discover new and impactful ways to integrate humans and robots.
