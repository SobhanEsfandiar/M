## The Room

This project was conducted in collaboration with  [AirLab](https://airlab.deib.polimi.it/) at Politecnico di Milano. You can read the full project description [here](https://airlab.deib.polimi.it/the-room/).

Robotics has long been associated with futuristic visions and speculative ideas. The concept of robots coexisting with humans in everyday environments has captured the imagination of both scholars and major tech corporations. Yet, despite this vision, the widespread use of social robots in daily life remains limited.

To understand the barriers preventing this integration, a more artistic and speculative approach can offer fresh insights by critically examining the current state of robotics. This study embraces a speculative methodology, focusing specifically on non-anthropomorphic social agents and their potential to create new opportunities for robots to become part of our social fabric.

The traditional approach to designing robots often relies on anthropomorphism or zoomorphism—designing robots to resemble humans or animals in order to make interactions more intuitive. However, what if robots don't need to mimic humans or animals to be perceived as social beings? What if they require an entirely new identity to be seen as a legitimate participant in human society?

This project explores the possibility of a radically different design approach, one that moves beyond anthropomorphism and zoomorphism. We envision a robotic entity that stands apart from traditional human-like or animal-like forms, yet is still capable of forming meaningful social interactions with its environment and visitors.

Additionally, we explore the role of teleoperation in enhancing the intentionality and expressiveness of robots, making them more present and responsive. In this context, we also consider the potential for robots to act as avatars in a physical metaverse, offering a novel and immersive way for humans to interact within a new digital realm.


## Yudo

This project was developed as part of the Social Robotics course at Politecnico di Milano.

Yudu is a socially interactive robot designed to capture attention in public spaces and encourage users to engage in a fun and beneficial stretching exercise routine.

University students often experience neck and shoulder pain after long hours of studying. Yudu comes to the rescue, offering a playful and relaxing experience that pairs perfectly with a coffee break. By combining physical activity with a touch of entertainment, Yudu promotes well-being in an enjoyable and engaging way.

Place Yudu near vending machines or in other public spaces, and watch as it actively attracts users to participate in a fun, interactive game. Whether it’s through its engaging personality or the creative design of its exercises, Yudu creates a unique moment of relaxation and connection in busy environments.

## Sleeptual

This project was developed as part of the Virtual and physical Prototyping  course at Politecnico di Milano.

The system connects a mobile app with a VR headset to deliver an all-encompassing sleep aid solution. Key features include:

* Immersive Natural Scenes: Users can explore calming VR environments, such as serene gardens, soothing rainforests, or snowy landscapes, enhanced by ambient sounds to create a deeply relaxing atmosphere.

* Breathing Exercises: Guided breathing sessions, complemented by visually engaging wave effects, help users achieve calmness and prepare their minds for rest.

* Environmental Monitoring: Real-time data on room temperature, humidity, and heart rate allow users to adjust their surroundings for optimal sleep conditions.

* Personalized Insights: A mobile dashboard and journal provide tailored sleep suggestions, helping users understand and improve their sleep habits over time.
