    "text": "Welcome to my personal website!\nI am Mohammadsobhan Esfandiar, a passionate researcher specializing in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), with a particular focus on Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR) in robotics, physical interaction design, and the role of social psychology in HRI. Currently, I am pursuing an MSc in Research Methods of Psychological Science at the University of Glasgow, where I am deepening my knowledge and skills in psychological research methodologies.\nMy academic journey will continue with a PhD focused on social touch in Human-Robot Interaction, exploring the ways in which touch influences the dynamics between humans and robots. My background in mechanical engineering and design has provided me with a strong foundation in technical craftsmanship, which complements my research pursuits.\nI enjoy investigating innovative and creative approaches within my field, always striving to push the boundaries of conventional research to discover new and impactful ways to integrate humans and robots."

    "text": "This project was conducted in collaboration with AirLab at Politecnico di Milano. You can read the full project description here.\n\nRobotics has long been associated with futuristic visions and speculative ideas. The concept of robots coexisting with humans in everyday environments has captured the imagination of both scholars and major tech corporations. Yet, despite this vision, the widespread use of social robots in daily life remains limited.\nTo understand the barriers preventing this integration, a more artistic and speculative approach can offer fresh insights by critically examining the current state of robotics. This study embraces a speculative methodology, focusing specifically on non-anthropomorphic social agents and their potential to create new opportunities for robots to become part of our social fabric.\nThe traditional approach to designing robots often relies on anthropomorphism or zoomorphism—designing robots to resemble humans or animals in order to make interactions more intuitive. However, what if robots don’t need to mimic humans or animals to be perceived as social beings? What if they require an entirely new identity to be seen as a legitimate participant in human society?\nThis project explores the possibility of a radically different design approach, one that moves beyond anthropomorphism and zoomorphism. We envision a robotic entity that stands apart from traditional human-like or animal-like forms, yet is still capable of forming meaningful social interactions with its environment and visitors. \nAdditionally, we explore the role of teleoperation in enhancing the intentionality and expressiveness of robots, making them more present and responsive. In this context, we also consider the potential for robots to act as avatars in a physical metaverse, offering a novel and immersive way for humans to interact within a new digital realm."

Yudu comes to the rescue, offering a playful and relaxing experience that pairs perfectly with a coffee break. By combining physical activity with a touch of entertainment, Yudu promotes well-being in an enjoyable and engaging way. \nPlace Yudu near vending machines or in other public spaces, and watch as it actively attracts users to participate in a fun, interactive game. Whether it’s through its engaging personality or the creative design of its exercises, Yudu creates a unique moment of relaxation and connection in busy environments."

This project integrates relaxation techniques, environmental monitoring, and biofeedback to promote better sleep quality and relaxation.\n\nThe system connects a mobile app with a VR headset to deliver an all-encompassing sleep aid solution. Key features include:\n\nImmersive Natural Scenes: Users can explore calming VR environments, such as serene gardens, soothing rainforests, or snowy landscapes, enhanced by ambient sounds to create a deeply relaxing atmosphere.\nBreathing Exercises: Guided breathing sessions, complemented by visually engaging wave effects, help users achieve calmness and prepare their minds for rest.\nEnvironmental Monitoring: Real-time data on room temperature, humidity, and heart rate allow users to adjust their surroundings for optimal sleep conditions.\nPersonalized Insights: A mobile dashboard and journal provide tailored sleep suggestions, helping users understand and improve their sleep habits over time.\n\n\nSleeptual is designed primarily for college students, a demographic particularly vulnerable to insomnia due to academic stress and irregular schedules. With a focus on usability and relaxation, the project explores the potential of VR and biofeedback to transform sleep aid technology."
