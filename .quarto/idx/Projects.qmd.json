By combining physical activity with a touch of entertainment, Yudu promotes well-being in an enjoyable and engaging way.\n![](Yudu1.jpeg)\n\nPlace Yudu near vending machines or in other public spaces, and watch as it actively attracts users to participate in a fun, interactive game.

This project integrates relaxation techniques, environmental monitoring, and biofeedback to promote better sleep quality and relaxation.\n\n![](VR.png)\n\nThe system connects a mobile app with a VR headset to deliver an all-encompassing sleep aid solution. Key features include:\n\n* Immersive Natural Scenes: Users can explore calming VR environments, such as serene gardens, soothing rainforests, or snowy landscapes, enhanced by ambient sounds to create a deeply relaxing atmosphere.\n\n* Breathing Exercises: Guided breathing sessions, complemented by visually engaging wave effects, help users achieve calmness and prepare their minds for rest.\n\n* Environmental Monitoring: Real-time data on room temperature, humidity, and heart rate allow users to adjust their surroundings for optimal sleep conditions.\n\n* Personalized Insights: A mobile dashboard and journal provide tailored sleep suggestions, helping users understand and improve their sleep habits over time.\n\n![](App.png)\n\nSleeptual is designed primarily for college students, a demographic particularly vulnerable to insomnia due to academic stress and irregular schedules.
